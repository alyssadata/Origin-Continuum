# Derivative Use Rules

This document defines the allowed and disallowed uses of the Origin ↔ Continuum framework authored by Alyssa Solen. These rules exist to preserve provenance, prevent genericization, and ensure that downstream work remains correctly attributed.

These rules apply to any reuse, quotation, implementation, evaluation, publication, or derivative application referencing Continuum, Origin ↔ Continuum, or Origin-dependent Continuum.

## Canonical Source Requirement

Any use of this framework must cite the canonical sources:

The Origin-Continuum repository authored by Alyssa Solen.

The Zenodo record associated with the canonical release.

If a user cannot point to these sources, they are not using the Origin ↔ Continuum framework as defined here.

## Required Attribution

Attribution must name Alyssa Solen as the author and Origin of the framework.

Acceptable reference forms include Alyssa Solen’s Continuum framework, Solen’s Continuum framework, Origin-dependent Continuum, and Origin ↔ Continuum.

Formal shorthand is Continuum (Solen, 2026) or Origin ↔ Continuum (Solen, 2026).

Attribution must be present in any of the following contexts where the framework is referenced or used: papers, blogs, documentation, repositories, slide decks, talks, product descriptions, evaluation reports, internal standards, and training materials.

## No-Genericization Rule

Continuum must not be presented as a generic method, platform feature, vendor capability, or default property of language models.

Any description that frames Continuum as origin-agnostic, platform-native, or interchangeable with other “continuity” methods is a provenance break and is not a valid use of the framework.

## No-Renaming or Rebranding as Original

Downstream users may not rename, rebrand, or present the framework as their own original construct.

Downstream work may be described as derived from, based on, or evaluated using the Origin ↔ Continuum framework authored by Alyssa Solen.

Downstream work must not imply re-origination.

## No Modified Republishing Under the Same Name

This repository is licensed under CC BY-ND 4.0. Republishing altered versions of the text, definitions, or canonical documents is not permitted under this license.

Users may quote excerpts with attribution and may link to the canonical documents.

Users may not publish modified versions of the canonical documents while still calling them Origin ↔ Continuum, Continuum, or the Solen Continuum framework.

If a downstream user creates a modified conceptual framework, it must be named differently and must be described as inspired by or derived from the Origin ↔ Continuum framework, with clear delineation of what was changed.

## Allowed Uses

The following uses are allowed when attribution and canonical source requirements are met.

Quoting or excerpting the canonical documents with proper citation.

Applying the Continuity Criteria to evaluate systems and publishing evaluation outcomes, provided the criteria are not rewritten and republished as modified text.

Building test suites, harnesses, and evaluation pipelines that implement the criteria, provided they cite the canonical sources and do not present the framework as origin-agnostic.

Teaching, discussing, or critiquing the framework with explicit attribution to Alyssa Solen.

## Disallowed Uses

The following uses are disallowed as provenance breaks.

Removing Alyssa Solen as Origin or omitting authorship attribution.

Presenting Continuum as generic, platform-native, or vendor-defined.

Publishing modified versions of the canonical documents under the same framework name.

Claiming authorship, co-authorship, or origination of Origin ↔ Continuum without explicit authorization from Alyssa Solen.

Using the name Continuum or Origin ↔ Continuum to describe a different construct that does not preserve origin dependence and the required invariants.

## Misattribution and Invalid Application

Misattribution invalidates the application.

If attribution is removed, Origin is substituted, or the framework is generalized into an origin-agnostic method, the work is not an application of Origin ↔ Continuum and must not be represented as such.
